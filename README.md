# Predictive Analysis on Heart Disease Dataset

This is a Machining Learning classification model using k-NN classification algorithm to predict one's probability of having heart disease based on one's health conditions.

For people having their cp, thalach, exang, slope, oldpeak health measurements, they can check against their heart health condition using this classifier. This classifier is also helpful for doctors to make immediate and primary predictions on the presence of heart disease of patients. If the classifier predicted that there is presence of heart disease of a patient, it notifies doctors to provide treatments timely.
